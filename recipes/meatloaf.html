    <h2>The Blueprint</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lean Ground Beef</strong>- Use 80% or 85% lean meat. Just like you were making our famous Hamburgers. The fat content will make it all moist and juicy, but you should avoid the super lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onions and Garlic</strong>- Both of these aromatics come together great and add plenty of flavor to the Meatloaf</li>
        <li><strong>Breadcrumbs and Eggs</strong>- Acts as binders to hold everything together. Instead of using Panko you could use ittalian breadcrumbs or even gluten-free breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li><strong>Ketchup</strong>- Adds flavor and tenderizes the ground beef. It's fine to substitute it with a Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce if you need to.</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>- You have to get the breadcrumbs wet, and it also helps tenderize the beef so it will be softer and juicier.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong>- Fresh parsley will add freshness to the Meatloaf, while the italian seasoning, salt and pepper will enhance the natural flavors of the beef.</li>
        <li><strong>For the Glaze</strong>- Combining ketchup, white vinegar, brown sugar, garlic powder and onion powder create a sweet and tangy glaze. If you don't have those, BBQ sauce will do the trick.</li>
    </ul>
