This is my very first project! This is all part of my progress through the Odin Porject. 
This project specifically is making a simple recipe website using HTMl and everything I have learned so far. 
I believe that to complete this I will need to have an understanding of basic HTMl, elements, and how to use images. I also believe that I am fairly capable of doing this!
